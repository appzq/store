# Store management console application
Manages users(admins and clients), existing products and placed orders.
Admin users are read from JSON and stored inside a sqllite DB, while user registration is available through the application and it's saved in the DB afterwards. Different menus are available based on user's role (admin or simple user).
A few products are read from txt file and the admin has also the permission to add products to DB.
